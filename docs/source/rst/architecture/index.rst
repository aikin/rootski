rootski is architected...

- |flag| with awesome practices!
- |users| to scale to thousands of concurrent users
- |dollar| to be cheap to run (~$20-30/mo)
- |secure| to be secure (data is backed up and secured, contributors and scripts
  have minimum-required access, network access and credentials are gated)
- |ghost| to be ephemeral: any piece of the architecture can be destroyed at any time
  and be recovered very quickly using code

Architecture Walkthrough
----------------------------------------------

This video explains the architecture in a way that is meant to be accessible
to people who are new to software architecture and running things in the cloud.

.. note::

    Most of this video is true to the architecture diagram above, but we
    have replaced the spot instance backend with API Gateway and a lightsail instance.
